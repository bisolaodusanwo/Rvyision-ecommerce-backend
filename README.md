UNDERSTANDING THE PORBLEM -:
The challenge was to build a backend for amid-sized e-commerce platorm. the platform should handle a large number of products and transactions efficiently while ensuring a smooth user experience. To do this, i focused on creating a reliable, scalable API using Node.js and MongoDB.

This backend includes the ability to :
Search products by name using a GET request.
Retrieve product details by using a dynamic route :ID as a GET request.
Also, add products with POST request

I aimed to keep the solution straightforward, focusing on core features while ensuring the system can scale as the platform grows.

Documentation
Installed Packages-:

1. Express
2. Mongoose (Since i will be using MongoDB for data modelling and interactions)
3. CORS
4. Dotenv
5. Nodemon

Testing:
I made use of POSTMAN for CRUD Operaton

In the root directory, i created a .env to set up the environment variables

API ENDPOINT
POST-: To test this add a product making sure it meets the condition of the schema, the send it the body

GET: To search product after POST it creates a unique ID in MongoDB please replace (ID) to get the details of the specific product required

Approaching this challenge, I focused on building a backend that could efficiently handle growing data while remaining simple and scalable. As I’m still building my experience, my priority was to deliver a solution that balances functionality with ease of use. I kept the design straightforward, ensuring that the API could manage core tasks like adding and retrieving products without introducing unnecessary complexity.

This was an interesting challenge, and I enjoyed working through it. I’m confident that this backend can serve as a solid starting point for a scalable e-commerce platform.
